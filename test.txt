add start pq_node to pq

while (pq is not empty)
    node = pop least cost node
    
    

    if pq_node is a goal node:
        record the cost to the goal
        record the parent of this node
        return getPath(parent),cost
    else if pq_node is not visited
        add this node to visited
        record parent

        for each of its adj nodes:
            cost_to_child = this_node_cost + (cost between this node and child node)

            add a pq_node into the pq => [cost_to_child,child_index,parent_index]
